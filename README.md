# Bike Rides in SF - Part B: Deep Learning Forecasting

This project is part of the **Zaka AI Data Science Specialization**. It focuses on **time-series forecasting** using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to predict the number of bike rides in San Francisco for the next **7 days**.

## ðŸ”¹ Difference Between Part A & Part B

- **Part A**: Focused on **time-series analysis** using statistical methods (decomposition, autocorrelation, and statistical forecasting models).
- **Part B**: Applies **deep learning** techniques, specifically **RNNs**, to predict future bike rides.

##  Dataset
- **San Francisco Bike Dataset** (June 28, 2017 â€“ December 31, 2018)
- Contains daily bike ride counts in San Francisco.

 **This repository contains the implementation for Part B, using an RNN for forecasting.**
